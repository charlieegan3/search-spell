# Search Spell

**Toy Learning Project**

This is a simple gem that makes use of [Ruru](https://github.com/d-unseductable/ruru) to implement a simple scraper in Rust that fetches spelling suggestions from search engines.

The Rust code can make requests in parallel and return them to the Ruby code.
